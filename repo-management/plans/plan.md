# S2DCartographer — Project Plan

## Azure Local Storage Spaces Direct Analysis, Visualization & Reporting Module

**Author:** Kristopher Turner (Country Cloud Boy)
**Organization:** AzureLocal (github.com/AzureLocal)
**Repo:** `AzureLocal/azurelocal-s2dcartographer`
**Module Name:** `S2DCartographer`
**License:** MIT
**Date:** April 2026

---

## 1. Project Naming

### Primary Recommendation: **S2DCartographer**

A cartographer creates detailed maps, charts, and diagrams of terrain — exactly what this tool does for Storage Spaces Direct. It maps raw physical disks through the storage pool, across resiliency layers, down to usable volume capacity, producing visual artifacts that make S2D understandable. Fits the Scout/Ranger explorer naming theme perfectly.

**PowerShell Gallery:** Name `S2DCartographer` does not exist on PSGallery as of April 2026.

### Alternate Names (if preferred)

| Name | Rationale | Vibe |
|------|-----------|------|
| **S2DSherpa** | A sherpa guides people through mountain complexity — fits your Appalachian location and the goal of guiding people through S2D confusion | Mountain guide |
| **S2DCompass** | Points people in the right direction for storage planning; short and memorable | Navigation |
| **S2DScope** | Scope out the storage landscape; clean, two-syllable punch | Reconnaissance |

### Naming Convention Alignment

| Project | Theme | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| Azure Scout | Broad Azure inventory explorer | Wide reconnaissance |
| Azure Local Ranger | Deep Azure Local cluster auditor | Focused patrol |
| **S2DCartographer** | S2D storage mapping & visualization | Detailed mapmaking |

## 2. Project Purpose & Problem Statement

### The Problem

Storage Spaces Direct is one of the most misunderstood technologies in the Azure Local / Windows Server ecosystem. Common pain points include:

1. **TiB vs TB confusion** — Drive manufacturers label disks in TB (decimal, 1 TB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes) while Windows reports in TiB (binary, 1 TiB = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes). A "1.92 TB" NVMe drive shows as ~1.75 TiB in Windows. Customers buy capacity expecting TB and get confused when the numbers don't match.

2. **Reserve space misunderstanding** — Microsoft recommends reserving the equivalent of one capacity drive per server (up to 4 drives). Many deployments ignore this entirely or get the math wrong, leaving clusters unable to self-heal after a drive failure.

3. **Resiliency overhead surprise** — Three-way mirror uses only 33.3% of raw capacity. Two-way mirror uses 50%. Customers provision expecting near-raw capacity and are shocked when volumes are smaller than expected.

4. **Infrastructure volume blindspot** — Azure Local automatically creates an infrastructure volume for cluster metadata and logs. This consumes pool capacity that customers didn't plan for.

5. **Mixed resiliency math** — Clusters with volumes using different mirror types (two-way, three-way, mirror-accelerated parity) have complex capacity math that existing calculators handle poorly.

6. **Thin vs fixed provisioning confusion** — Thin-provisioned volumes can be overcommitted, leading to dangerous out-of-space conditions that customers don't detect until it's too late.

7. **No "expected vs actual" comparison** — Existing calculators are planning tools. Nothing connects to a live cluster to compare what the storage *should* look like versus what it *actually* looks like.

### The Solution

**S2DCartographer** connects to a live Azure Local cluster, inventories every layer of the storage stack (physical disks → cache tier → capacity tier → storage pool → virtual disks → volumes), and produces:

- **Capacity waterfall diagrams** showing raw → after cache → after reserve → after resiliency → after infrastructure volume → usable capacity
- **Health assessments** with clear pass/fail indicators for reserve adequacy, resiliency coverage, and thin-provisioning risk
- **Publication-quality reports** in HTML, Word, PDF, and Excel formats suitable for customer deliverables, architecture reviews, and operational documentation
- **TiB/TB dual-display** throughout all outputs, eliminating unit confusion permanently

---

## 3. TiB vs TB Strategy

This is a first-class concern, not an afterthought. S2DCartographer handles it as follows:

### Display Philosophy: Always Show Both

Every capacity value in every output (console, report, diagram) is displayed in **dual format**:

```
Raw Capacity:  13.97 TiB  (15.36 TB)
Usable Space:   4.66 TiB  ( 5.12 TB)
```

### Implementation

```powershell
# Core conversion class used throughout the module
class S2DCapacity {
    [int64]$Bytes
    [double]$TiB        # Binary: bytes / 1099511627776
    [double]$TB         # Decimal: bytes / 1000000000000
    [double]$GiB        # Binary: bytes / 1073741824
    [double]$GB         # Decimal: bytes / 1000000000
    [string]$Display    # "13.97 TiB (15.36 TB)"
}
```

### User-Configurable Default

```powershell
# Module preference variable
$S2DCartographerPreference = @{
    PrimaryUnit = 'TiB'     # or 'TB' — controls which appears first
    ShowDual    = $true      # always show both; $false for single-unit mode
}
```

### Report Handling

- **Console output**: Dual format, TiB primary by default
- **HTML reports**: Dual format with tooltip showing bytes
- **Excel reports**: Separate TiB and TB columns with raw bytes in a hidden column
- **Word/PDF reports**: Dual format inline, with a terminology appendix explaining the difference
- **Diagrams**: Primary unit with secondary in parentheses, to avoid visual clutter

### Educational Component

Every report includes a brief "Understanding Storage Units" section explaining that a "1.92 TB" drive label means the drive holds 1,920,000,000,000 bytes, which Windows displays as approximately 1.75 TiB. This section demystifies the discrepancy once and for all.

## 5. Authentication & Connectivity Model

Following the Azure Local Ranger and Azure Scout patterns:

### Connection Methods

```powershell
# Method 1: Direct WinRM/CIM to cluster node (domain-joined management machine)
Connect-S2DCluster -ClusterName "c01-prd-bal" -Credential (Get-Credential)

# Method 2: Pre-existing CIM session
$session = New-CimSession -ComputerName "node01" -Credential $cred
Connect-S2DCluster -CimSession $session

# Method 3: PowerShell remoting session
$psSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName "node01" -Credential $cred
Connect-S2DCluster -PSSession $psSession

# Method 4: Local execution (run directly on a cluster node)
Connect-S2DCluster -Local

# Method 5: Key Vault credential retrieval (Ranger pattern)
Connect-S2DCluster -ClusterName "c01-prd-bal" `
    -KeyVaultName "kv-hcs-vault-01" `
    -SecretName "cluster-admin-cred"
```

### Session Management

```powershell
# Module-scoped session state
$Script:S2DSession = @{
    ClusterName    = $null
    Nodes          = @()
    CimSession     = $null
    PSSession      = $null
    IsConnected    = $false
    CollectedData  = @{}    # Cache collected data for report generation
}
```

### Authentication Flow

1. Accept credential via parameter, existing session, or Key Vault
2. Validate connectivity to at least one cluster node
3. Discover all cluster nodes via `Get-ClusterNode`
4. Validate S2D is enabled via `Get-ClusterS2D`
5. Store session for subsequent collector cmdlets
6. All collectors use the established session — no re-authentication per cmdlet

---

## 6. Collector Domains

### 6.1 Physical Disk Inventory (`Get-S2DPhysicalDiskInventory`)

**PowerShell Data Sources:**

| Cache tier health | Warning | Any cache disks degraded or missing? |

---

## 7. Capacity Math Engine (`Get-S2DCapacityWaterfall`)

This is the core intellectual property of the module. It computes the full capacity waterfall:

### Waterfall Stages

```
Stage 1: Raw Physical Capacity
    Total bytes across all capacity-tier disks on all nodes
    (Cache disks excluded — they don't contribute to capacity)

Stage 2: After Vendor Labeling Adjustment
    Show the discrepancy: disks are labeled in TB but Windows sees TiB
    Example: 8 × "1.92 TB" NVMe = 15.36 TB labeled → 13.97 TiB actual

Stage 3: After Storage Pool Overhead
    Minor metadata overhead consumed by the pool itself (~0.5-1%)

Stage 4: After Reserve Space
    Recommended: 1 capacity drive per node, up to 4 drives total
    Reserve = min(NodeCount, 4) × LargestCapacityDriveSize
    This space must remain UNALLOCATED in the pool

Stage 5: After Infrastructure Volume
    Azure Local auto-creates an infrastructure volume for:
      - Cluster metadata
      - Storage bus logs
      - Cluster shared volume metadata
    Typically 250-500 GB depending on cluster size

Stage 6: Available for Workload Volumes
    This is what remains for user-created volumes BEFORE resiliency

Stage 7: After Resiliency Overhead (per volume)
    Three-way mirror: usable = footprint ÷ 3  (33.3% efficiency)
    Two-way mirror:   usable = footprint ÷ 2  (50% efficiency)
    Dual parity:      usable depends on encoding (50-80% efficiency)
    Nested mirror:    ~25% efficiency (two-node clusters)
    Mirror-accel parity: ~35-40% efficiency

Stage 8: Final Usable Capacity
    Sum of all volume usable capacities
    This is what VMs/workloads can actually consume
```

### Mixed Resiliency Handling

When a cluster has volumes with different resiliency types, the waterfall computes each volume's overhead independently and produces a blended efficiency:

```powershell
# Example: 3-node cluster, 60 TiB raw
# Volume "VMs"    = 15 TiB three-way mirror → 45 TiB footprint
# Volume "Archive" = 10 TiB dual parity    → 16.7 TiB footprint
# Total footprint: 61.7 TiB — WARNING: exceeds available pool capacity!
```

### "Expected vs Actual" Comparison

The core differentiator. For each stage, show:

| Stage | Expected (Best Practice) | Actual (This Cluster) | Status |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Reserve space | 13.97 TiB | 2.1 TiB (unallocated) | ⚠️ INSUFFICIENT |
| Infrastructure volume | Present | Present (256 GB) | ✅ OK |
| Volumes provisioned | ≤ available capacity | 105% overcommit | 🔴 CRITICAL |

## 13. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Pester 5)

- **Capacity conversion**: Verify TiB/TB math for known drive sizes
- **Reserve calculation**: Test with 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16 node configurations
- **Resiliency efficiency**: Test all mirror and parity types
- **Waterfall stages**: End-to-end math with mock cluster data
- **Health checks**: Each check with pass and fail scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Test against mock CIM session data (serialized from real clusters)
- Test report generation produces valid HTML/docx/xlsx/PDF files
- Test diagram SVG output is well-formed

### Mock Data Sets

| Mock File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `2node-allnvme.json` | 2-node, all NVMe, two-way mirror, healthy |
| `3node-mixed-tier.json` | 3-node, NVMe cache + SSD capacity, three-way mirror |
| `4node-3way-mirror.json` | 4-node, three-way mirror, some thin provisioned |
| `4node-mixed-resiliency.json` | 4-node with both mirror and parity volumes |
| `16node-enterprise.json` | 16-node, max scale, mixed everything |
| `2node-overcommitted.json` | 2-node with thin overcommit — should trigger warnings |
| `3node-insufficient-reserve.json` | 3-node with all space allocated — critical reserve failure |
| `single-node.json` | Single-node cluster (local mirror only) |
