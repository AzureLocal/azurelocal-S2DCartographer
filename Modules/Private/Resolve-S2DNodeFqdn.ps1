# Resolve-S2DNodeFqdn — derive a fan-out target FQDN for a cluster node short name.
#
# On workgroup/non-domain-joined management machines, CIM/WinRM sessions typically
# only succeed against fully qualified names listed in TrustedHosts. The cluster's
# MSCluster_Node enumeration returns short names (e.g. 'tplabs-01-n01'). This helper
# converts them to FQDNs so per-node fan-out operations actually reach the target.
#
# Strategy, in order:
#   1. If $ShortName already contains a dot, treat it as a FQDN and return unchanged.
#   2. If $ClusterFqdn contains a dot, extract its domain suffix and append to $ShortName.
#   3. Fall back to [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry() to let the OS resolver produce a FQDN.
#   4. If all else fails, return $ShortName unchanged and emit a verbose note — the caller
#      will surface a precise error at preflight if fan-out won't work.
#
# This function performs no network I/O except the optional DNS fallback (step 3) and is
# safe to call with bogus inputs during unit tests by passing a $ClusterFqdn that contains
# a dot (step 2 wins before DNS is consulted).
